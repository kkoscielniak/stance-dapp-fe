# Stance Demo dApp: Front-end

A React app that interacts with [my very first smart contract](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/stance-dapp). WIP. 

> This is a work in progress repository for learning purposes. Things might be messy.

## Development
1. Create `.env` file and add configuration keys according to `.env.template`. 
2. Run `yarn start`.
